# 12 Plots of Christmas ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ…

Welcome to the 12 Plots of Christmas repository! In this project, we showcase a collection of 12 different plots created using R (& SAS) programming language to celebrate the holiday season.

## Plots

Each plot represents a unique visualization related to Christmas themes and data analysis. Here's a brief overview of the plots:

1.  **Bumpchart animation**: A bump chart of the relative UK Chart positions of 5 classic Christmas songs.
